      "text": "\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. “What are Prince Vasíli and that son of his to me? Prince Vasíli is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,” he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. “And why should she marry?” he thought. “To be unhappy for certain. There’s Lise, married to Andrew—a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays—but is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They’ll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?” So thought Prince Bolkónski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince Vasíli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. “Well, I’ve nothing against it,” the prince said to himself, “but he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.”\n\n“That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!” he added aloud.\n\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess’ dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s ribbon, Princess Mary’s unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s and Anatole’s smiles, and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. “Got herself up like a fool!” he thought, looking irritably at her. “She is shameless, and he ignores her!”\n\nHe went straight up to Prince Vasíli.\n\n“Well! How d’ye do? How d’ye do? Glad to see you!”\n\n“Friendship laughs at distance,” began Prince Vasíli in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. “Here is my second son; please love and befriend him.”\n\nPrince Bolkónski surveyed Anatole.\n\n“Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!” he said. “Well, come and kiss me,” and he offered his cheek.\n\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.\n\nPrince Bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasíli, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasíli said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.\n\n“And so they are writing from Potsdam already?” he said, repeating Prince Vasíli’s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.\n\n“Is it for visitors you’ve got yourself up like that, eh?” said he. “Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.”\n\n“It was my fault, mon père,” interceded the little princess, with a blush.\n\n“You must do as you please,” said Prince Bolkónski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, “but she need not make a fool of herself, she’s plain enough as it is.”\n\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was reduced to tears.\n\n“On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,” said Prince Vasíli.\n\n“Now you, young prince, what’s your name?” said Prince Bolkónski, turning to Anatole, “come here, let us talk and get acquainted.”\n\n“Now the fun begins,” thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince.\n\n“Well, my dear boy, I hear you’ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?” asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.\n\n“No, I have been transferred to the line,” said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.\n\n“Ah! That’s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?”\n\n“No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?” said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.\n\n“A splendid soldier, splendid! ‘What am I attached to!’ Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Prince Bolkónski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolkónski frowned.\n\n“You may go,” he said to Anatole.\n\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladie"

      "text": "Cecily.  [Advancing to meet her.]  Pray let me introduce myself to you.  My name is Cecily Cardew. Gwendolen.  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people are never wrong.              Cecily.  How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such a comparatively short time.  Pray sit down.              Gwendolen.  [Still standing up.]  I may call you Cecily, may I not?              Cecily.  With pleasure!              Gwendolen.  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won’t you?              Cecily.  If you wish.              Gwendolen.  Then that is all quite settled, is it not?              Cecily.  I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]              Gwendolen.  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I am.  My father is Lord Bracknell.  You have never heard of papa, I suppose?              Cecily.  I don’t think so.              Gwendolen.  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seems to me to be the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?  And I don’t like that.  It makes men so very attractive.  Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?              Cecily.  Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.  I am very fond of being looked at.              Gwendolen.  [After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.]  You are here on a short visit, I suppose.              Cecily.  Oh no!  I live here.              Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?              Cecily.  Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.              Gwendolen.  Indeed?              Cecily.  My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous task of looking after me.              Gwendolen.  Your guardian?              Cecily.  Yes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.              Gwendolen.  Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward.  How secretive of him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am not sure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.  [Rising and going to her.]  I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you!  But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr. Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were—well, just a little older than you seem to be—and not quite so very alluring in appearance.  In fact, if I may speak candidly—              Cecily.  Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.              Gwendolen.  Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.  Ernest has a strong upright nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour.  Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception.  But even men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others.  Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to.  If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.              Cecily.  I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?              Gwendolen.  Yes.              Cecily.  Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It is his brother—his elder brother.              Gwendolen.  [Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a brother.              Cecily.  I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.              Gwendolen.  Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I have never heard any man mention his brother.  The subject seems distasteful to most men.  Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growing almost anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?  Of course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?              Cecily.  Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.              Gwendolen.  [Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?              Cecily.  [Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why I should make a secret of it to you.  Our little county newspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to be married.              Gwendolen.  [Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think there must be some slight error.  Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.  The announcement will appear in the Morning Post on Saturday at the latest.              Cecily.  [Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under some misconception.  Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows diary.]              Gwendolen.  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It is certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30.  If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.  [Produces diary of her own.]  I never travel without my diary.  One should always have something sensational to read in the train.  I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.              Cecily.  It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.              Gwendolen.  [Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a firm hand.              Cecily.  [Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are married.              Gwendolen.  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  You are presumptuous.  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one’s mind.  It becomes a pleasure.              Cecily.  Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an engagement?  How dare you?  This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners.  When I see a spade I call it a spade.              Gwendolen.  [Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade.  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.              [Enter Merriman, followed by the footman.  He carries a salver, table cloth, and plate stand.  Cecily is about to retort.  The presence of the servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls chafe.]              Merriman.  Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?              Cecily.  [Sternly, in a calm voice.]  Yes, as usual.  [Merriman begins to clear table and lay cloth.  A long pause.  Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each other.]              Gwendolen.  Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?              Cecily.  Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quite close one can see five counties.              Gwendolen.  Five counties!  I don’t think I should like that; I hate crowds.              Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]              Gwendolen.  [Looking round.]  Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.              Cecily.  So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.              Gwendolen.  I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.              Cecily.  Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.              Gwendolen.  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the country, if anybody who is anybody does.  The country always bores me to death.              Cecily.  Ah!  This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it not?  I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at present.  It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told.  May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?              Gwendolen.  [With elaborate politeness.]  Thank you.  [Aside.]  Detestable girl!  But I require tea!              Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  Sugar?              Gwendolen.  [Superciliously.]  No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable any more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.]              Cecily.  [Severely.]  Cake or bread and butter?              Gwendolen.  [In a bored manner.]  Bread and butter, please.  Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.              Cecily.  [Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]  Hand that to Miss Fairfax.              [Merriman does so, and goes out with footman.  Gwendolen drinks the tea and makes a grimace.  Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the bread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake.  Rises in indignation.]              Gwendolen.  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  I am known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.              Cecily.  [Rising.]  To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.              Gwendolen.  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that you were false and deceitful.  I am never deceived in such matters.  My first impressions of people are invariably right.              Cecily.  It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable time.  No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make in the neighbourhood.              [Enter Jack.]              Gwendolen.  [Catching sight of him.]  Ernest!  My own Ernest!              Jack.  Gwendolen!  Darling!  [Offers to kiss her.]              Gwendolen.  [Draws back.]  A moment!  May I ask if you are engaged to be married to this young lady?  [Points to Cecily.]              Jack.  [Laughing.]  To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?              Gwendolen.  Thank you.  You may!  [Offers her cheek.]              Cecily.  [Very sweetly.]  I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.  The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my guardian, Mr. John Worthing.              Gwendolen.  I beg your pardon?              Cecily.  This is Uncle Jack.              Gwendolen.  [Receding.]  Jack!  Oh!              [Enter Algernon.]              Cecily.  Here is Ernest.              Algernon.  [Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.]  My own love!  [Offers to kiss her.]              Cecily.  [Drawing back.]  A moment, Ernest!  May I ask you—are you engaged to be married to this young lady?              Algernon.  [Looking round.]  To what young lady?  Good heavens!  Gwendolen!              Cecily.  Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.              Algernon.  [Laughing.]  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?              Cecily.  Thank you.  [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.]  You may.  [Algernon kisses her.]              Gwendolen.  I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.  The gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.              Cecily.  [Breaking away from Algernon.]  Algernon Moncrieff!  Oh!  [The two girls move towards each other and put their arms round each other’s waists as if for protection.]              Cecily.  Are you called Algernon?              Algernon.  I cannot deny it.              Cecily.  Oh!              Gwendolen.  Is your name really John?              Jack.  [Standing rather proudly.]  I could deny it if I liked.  I could deny anything if I liked.  But my name certainly is John.  It has been John for years.              Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  A gross deception has been practised on both of us.              Gwendolen.  My poor wounded Cecily!              Cecily.  My sweet wronged Gwendolen!              Gwendolen.  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will you not?  [They embrace.  Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]              Cecily.  [Rather brightly.]  There is just one question I would like to be allowed to ask my guardian.              Gwendolen.  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would like to be permitted to put to you.  Where is your brother Ernest?  We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at present.              Jack.  [Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth.  It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at all.  I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future.              Cecily.  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?              Jack.  [Cheerily.]  None!              Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind?              Jack.  [Pleasantly.]  Never.  Not even of any kind.              Gwendolen.  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to be married to any one.              Cecily.  It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in.  Is it?              Gwendolen.  Let us go into the house.  They will hardly venture to come after us there.              Cecily.  No, men are so cowardly, aren’t they?              [They retire into the house with scornful looks.]              Jack.  This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?              Algernon.  Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is.  The most wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my life.              Jack.  Well, you’ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.              Algernon.  That is absurd.  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses.  Every serious Bunburyist knows that."

It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and say, 'Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!' and then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great chair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always rather a noticing way—not a quick way, oh, no!—a silent way of noticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to understand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding. When I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But even that may be my vanity.\n\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance—like some of the princesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming—by my godmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good woman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there were lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had ever smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel—but she never smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good herself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown all her life. I felt so different from her, even making every allowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so poor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained with her—no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very sorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and I used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I talked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have loved her if I had been a bett"
